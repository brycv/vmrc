Known vmrc Issues

1. bhyveload has a 31 character VM name limit
2. "detached" VMs do not auto-cleanup as they are independent of parent process
3. Templates prefixed with dyn_ need frequent updating. (i.e. snapshots)
4. Several GNU/Linux templates are incomplete, perhaps only including ISO boot
   but not img boot. Please figure out the various installers and report back
   with and installer crash course or the proper img boot arguments.
5. There may be a limit to the number of arguments (VMs) that can be fed into an
   rc script. Please test.
6. Please test automatic VM load with multiple VMs.
7. Copying the host_nic, host_bridge and host_zpool ariables in vm.conf to
   individual templates should override the global variables. Please test.
8. Will removing the ZFS feature flags enable all on "current" OSs? Please test.
9. Must convince PC-BSD, TrueOS, NAS4Free, mfsbsd and BSDRP to update their ttys
   files/getty entries to be serial-friendly.

Known Feature Requests

1. Add to /usr/ports (Must shorten the above list first)
2. Multiple Bridge Support (Move to bridge/tap/MAC address sets? How many max?)
3. Make it behave like "the cloud thing we used at my last job, even though our
   team hated it".
4. Remove dependence on tap networking. (Suggestions? vnet? Not a bhyve issue)
5. Remove non-bhyve functionality. (Wait until you need QEMU to configure a VM)

Ideas

1. Support VirtualBox (Would require config file generation)
2. Support OpenBSD sysjail and ldoms
3. Support NetBSD/Xen
