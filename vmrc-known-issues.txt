Known vmrc Issues/To do

0. Not checking if tmux, screen, tightvnc and other dependencies are installed
1. bhyveload has a 31 character VM name limit
2. bhyve will not yet report *which* backing device is missing (Pending)
3. bhyve UEFI-GOP does not support numbered VNC "displays"
4. mkvm.sh img UFS installs will fail to boot unless the VM's fstab is set
   to ada0 (See notes at the bottom of the template)
5. VM networking will NOT survive 'service netif restart' because the required
   values are not in loader.conf or rc.conf. To add them persistently:

/boot/loader.conf
vmm_load="YES"
if_bridge_load="YES"
#bridgestp_load="YES"
if_tap_load="YES"

/etc/sysctl.conf
net.link.tap.up_on_open=1
#net.inet.ip.forwarding=1

/etc/rc.conf
cloned_interfaces="bridge0"			<- Use values from your system
ifconfig_bridge0="addm em0 addm tap8000"	<- Use values from your system
ifconfig_tap8000="up"


VM Operating System Notes

Exeriment with the "-w" "-W" and "-A" "bhyve_flags" in the VM configuration file
to diagnose compatibility issues.


FreeBSD

FreeBSD requires bhyve AHCI table generation via the "-A" flag.

FreeBSD does not support an xhci USB tablet with UEFI-GOP.

Early versions of FreeBSD 10.* and older require a change to /etc/ttys to allow
for the use of a serial console in the absense of a video console:

ttyu0 "/usr/libexec/getty 3wire.9600"  vt100  on secure


OpenBSD

Older versions of OpenBSD require the amd_hostbridge and newer ones may perform
faster with it under higher loads.

OpenBSD is not yet compatible with UEFI-GOP but the bug is being tracked down.


NetBSD

NetBSD only supports legacy interrupts and thus cannot support PCI numbering
beyond 0:0 though 31:7. 0:0:0 entries may cause an error.


Microsoft Windows

Microsoft Windows only supports legacy interrupts and thus cannot support PCI
numbering beyond 0:0 though 31:7. 0:0:0 entries will cause an error.

Desktop versions of Windows require a dummy CD-ROM device to be attached for
licensing purposes. Simly 'touch' a file name and attach it as an ahci-cd disc.
