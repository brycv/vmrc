Obviously you have downloaded vmrc via a snapshot or GitHub.

vmrc is designed to run on FreeBSD 10.0 or newer.


Step 1. Install the required package:

pkg install tmux

Suggested packages and additional containers:

pkg install tmux screen grub2-bhyve qemu xen

Note the instructions at the end of the Xen installation if you plan to run Xen.

The fetch-uefi-firmware.sh script retrieves UEFI firmware for want of a port at
this time of writing.


Step 2. For bhyve, verify that your hardware supports EPT:

dmesg | grep EPT
or
dmesg | grep POPCNT


3. Edit the vmrc.conf global configuration file before running install-vmrc.sh

The default directories will work unless you prefer relocate their contents.

Set your zpool name in "host_zpool" for ZFS dataset and zvol use.

Set an active network adapter in "bridge0_nic". The popular "em0" is preset.


4. Run the installer:

sh install-vmrc.sh


5. Verify that you have Internet access and create a VM with mkvm.sh

Interactive: sh mkvm.sh

Non-interactive: sh mkvm.sh fbsd103iso freebsd

The latter will create a virtual machine in /vmrc/vm/ named "freebsd0" that is
installed via ISO CD file and has a 2GB boot image. The default image size can
be modified in vi during the interactive mode or directly in the "fbsd103iso"
template in /vmrc/templates/

The template is copied to /vmrc/vm/freebsd0/vm.conf and the ISO is retrieved
from the specified source automatically. The VM is configured to boot with
the bhyve hypervisor but the "vm_container" parameter can be set to "xen".

QEMU does not support "install" mode yet but is planned to.


If successful, mkvm.sh will prompt you with instructions to start the VM:

service vm oneinstall freebsd0 ; service vm oneattach freebsd0


"vm" is the rc script and "one" is used if vm is not enabled in rc.conf

The "install" directive instructs bhyve or Xen to boot to the install ISO
rather than disk image for the installation process.

Once installation is complete, the VM can be shut down and booted from HD with:

service vm onestart freebsd0 ; service vm oneattach freebsd0


For an idea of exactly what vmrc is doing, consider running:

service vm onedryruninstall freebsd0
and
service vm onedryrun freebsd0

These will generate the install and non-install boot scripts as:

/vmrc/vm/freebsd0/bhyve.sh

This is the script called during "start" and can be modified in place for
experimentation and debugging.

To boot a modified bhyve.sh or xen.sh script, run:

service vm onedryboot freebsd0 && service vm oneattach freebsd0

Or in the captive console:

sh /vmrc/vm/freebsd0/bhyve.sh

Note that any modifications to the boot script will be overwritten if
"install" or "start" are run again. Nearly any parameter you set can be
put in vm.conf for permanent use.


Additional host bridges and VM disks or NICs can be added using the existing
host0/disk0/nic0 syntax by only incrementing the number. The configuration file
indicates what parameters are required.
